#### Hello there, recently I've been feeling really motivated to draw, and to improve my drawings, so this is a little approach to that area of my life in particular.

Past year was quite the experience, I did a lot of stuff that I didn't even thought about before, and because of that I kinda left behind drawing. Even though it was worth it, I wanted to get back into this activity that I enjoyed so much, and I knew that it was gonna take an essential role in my future, because a while back I noticed that Systems Engineering by it's own wasn't gonna cut it for me, I need that artistic/graphic/creative element in my life.

So I started doing some really elaborated drawings in a rush to see incredible results asap, but I was copying other people's work (mainly mangas) and drawing from reference too much, the creative side of drawing wasn't even taken into account. I realized about it and started creating my own stuff, which was really odd at the beginning but my creativity is being put to work and that's what matters.
