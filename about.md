## The blog
----



My name is Luis Eduardo Martín De La Peña. I'm studying Systems Engineering at the National University of Colombia. I'm 22 years old and live in Bogotá D.C.

### _Interests:_

My mains interest right now is to get better at drawing. This is an activity I enjoy a lot and hopefully I can make a life of it by gathering the necessary knowledge to be an animator or illustrator, either of those. The important thing here is that this is the activity I prioritize the most right now.

### _Hobbies:_

Other than drawing I like to spend my time reading novels, I principally like those that carry a really magic/cozy/warm/well constructed atmosphere. those that take me to places that make my mind feel comfortable. It doesn't have to be a world where everything is good and no one hates each other. It can go from the most amazing world of all to a decadent and lowlife place, from one of the most expensive hotels in _Death in Venice_ or the court houses in the XIX century Russia from Tolstoy books in general, to the monotone, gray and depressing wallstreet at the beginning of the XX century in Herman Melvin's book _Bartleby_. I love a book that makes me breathe it's atmosphere, that makes me believe I am in that specific place and time, that's what I value the most. And the same for movies, TV shows, comics, mangas, etc.

### _A nice example is the animated movie Akira(1988) by Katsuhiro Otomo_

This film redefined the futuristic view of the world to a more dystopian kinda realities, and everything in this movie is well integrated to that purpose.

### _These are some titles that I like:_

### _Personal projects:_

This is a project for Software Architecture class that I took past semester. It is about a light manager application for an intelligent house, I must say that this is just an abstraction to the problem, there was no real intelligent house but we were focused on implementing the different design patterns from the architectural point of view.

This repository contains the front-end of the app, where I mainly contributed to:



This other one contains the back-end:
